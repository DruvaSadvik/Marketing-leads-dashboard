A lead is someone who expresses interest in your SaaS product by supplying contact information. When a lead is formed within your database, it implies that the prospect has entered the marketing funnel, also known as hand raisers.

To move leads down the funnel, two company departments collaborate: marketing and sales. Generally, it is Marketing's responsibility to produce or uncover demand for leads and nurture them to the status of Sales Accepted Lead (or Sales Qualified Lead). Once that conversion occurs, Sales can work with the prospect to finally convert them to a customer.


As an example, consider a data-driven Marketing team. The Marketing team's OKR (Objective and Key Results) for this quarter is to deliver 26,000 MQLs (Marketing Qualified Leads).

You can develop a leads dashboard that measures target achievement, conversion, lead status, and income to ensure that the Marketing team's efforts are on track.
